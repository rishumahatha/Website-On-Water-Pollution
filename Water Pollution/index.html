        <div class="row">
          <div class="ccol">
            <h3>Chemical Pollution</h3>
            <p>
              <b>1.Industrial-Pollution:</b> Many industrial wastes contain toxic chemicals that can harm or kill aquatic life. These chemicals can also bioaccumulate, meaning that they can build up in the tissues of animals and humans over time. Some of the most common toxic chemicals found in industrial wastes include heavy metals, such as lead and mercury, and organic compounds, such as pesticides and herbicides.<br /><br>
              <b>2.Agricultural-Pollution:</b> Agricultural chemicals, including pesticides and herbicides, can be washed into water bodies through runoff. These substances may have toxic effects on aquatic organisms, disrupting the balance of ecosystems and affecting non-target species.<br /><br>
              <b>3.Municipal-Pollution:</b> Municipal wastes often include plastic products that, over time, break down into microplastics. These microplastics can enter water bodies through runoff, leading to water pollution. Microplastics can have adverse effects on aquatic life and may eventually enter the food chain.
